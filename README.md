# amazon-user-segmentation
Amazon uses machine learning techniques to learn about our items, users,
and how users interact with the items. Amazon Personalize segments
users based on their preferences for different products, categories, brands,
and more. I designed a project on how Amazon segmented the users by
using the K Algorithm, here I have used K means cluster. Everyone have
unique homepage in amazon.com because they uses their last or previous
data to next how our homepage visible. In this project for AMAZON User
Segmentation, I have used Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I
have used many different techniques in creating this project. To name a
few techniques that I have used in this project are :
Data Preprocessing, Data Filtering, Encoding the data, Serialization,
Clustering, Entropy, Training the algorithm etc.
